<p>
Hourly challenges in Rise of Empires were previously called daily challenges.
</p><p>
The hourly challenges in the game come and go every hour. (with a 5 minute break) and give you 55 minutes to complete up to 3 stages to unlock chests with rewards. Knowing what challenges are coming up each day is a helpful tool to make sure you can maximise the rewards you get.
</p><p>
Below is a list of the known hourly challenges on each day to help you plan.
</p><p>
Each day starts at the daily Reset and follows the in game time clock. You can see this time by going to the settings menu. All the challenges are on an 8 hour set and repeat 3 times a day.
</p><p>
These lists are the known hourly challenges at this time. They have been changed and updated in the game in the past and may change again. We will update here as soon as we can if they change, If you notice any incorrect entries and changes please comment below.

NOTE: If your state is new and you have not yet started on the Clash of Province events then your hourly challenges list will be slightly different. Please see the Initial schedule of daily events for your challenges list.
